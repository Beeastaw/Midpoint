# Midpoint - Group 20
Planning a night out with friends but cant decide where to go? Want to get dinner with your significant other but neither of you can decide which establishment is for you? Well Midpoint is your app!

Midpoint is an applicaion to make getting together with friends easier. Sign up and create a group through our interface. Form there, you can all put your current locations in, and it will give you a list of places in the middle of all of you. You can then filter this list by a budget range, type of place (eg activity or food). Then all you have to do is pick your place and you are off, enjoying time out on the town with your friends.
